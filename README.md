This repository contains our final project for i310D, where we developed a machine learning model to predict marital status using demographic data from the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the U.S. Census. Our methods included logistic regression and a neural network, processed using Python and the DuckDB package for optimal data handling and analysis.

### Repository Contents:
- **Data Descriptions**: Scripts and notebooks detailing how we processed the PUMS data, focusing on regions around Austin, Texas. This includes cleaning data, handling zeros in the dataset, and feature engineering. The .md file is cleaned for casual viewing while the .txt file excplicitly states what each attribute of each variable controls.
- **.ipynb File**: Code and explanation for our binary classification models using logistic regression and a MultiLayered Perceptron (MLP). Also includes the use of LIME for model interpretability.
- **Results**: Analysis and visualizations of model performances and their implications on predicting marital status.

### How to Run:
To view and run the Jupyter Notebook associated with this project, you can use [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org/). Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Jupyter Notebook file (`mainproj.ipynb`) in the repository.
2. Copy the URL of the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Visit [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org/) in your web browser.
4. Paste the copied URL into the input field on the nbviewer website.
5. Press Enter or click on the "Go!" button.
6. nbviewer will render the Jupyter Notebook, allowing you to view the code, visualizations, and markdown content.
7. You can interact with the notebook by running code cells, modifying parameters, and exploring the analysis.

By using nbviewer.org, you can easily access and run the Jupyter Notebook without requiring a local Jupyter environment. Feel free to experiment with the code and explore the analysis presented in the notebook.

### Additional Notes:
All code was reviewed and edited for clarity and functionality. Visual aids used in the report are included to better illustrate findings.
