This repository contains our final project for i310D, where we developed a machine learning model to predict marital status using demographic data from the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the U.S. Census. Our methods included logistic regression and a neural network, processed using Python and the DuckDB package for optimal data handling and analysis.

### Repository Contents:
- **Data Description**: Scripts and notebooks detailing how we processed the PUMS data, focusing on regions around Austin, Texas. This includes cleaning data, handling zeros in the dataset, and feature engineering.
- **Methodology**: Code and explanation for our binary classification models using logistic regression and a MultiLayered Perceptron (MLP). Also includes the use of LIME for model interpretability.
- **Results**: Analysis and visualizations of model performances and their implications on predicting marital status.
- **Conclusion and Future Work**: Summary of findings, limitations of our current model, and potential future improvements.
- **Appendix**: Q&A discussions post-presentation.
- **References**: Detailed citations of all datasets, libraries, and tools used.

### How to Run:
Instructions on how to set up and run the analysis are provided in the respective script and notebook headers.

### Additional Notes:
All code was reviewed and edited for clarity and functionality. Visual aids used in the report are included to better illustrate findings.
